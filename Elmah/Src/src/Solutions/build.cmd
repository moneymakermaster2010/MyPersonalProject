REM This is a batch file that can used to build ELMAH for Microsoft .NET 
REM Framework 1.x and 2.0. The build is created for only those versions
REM that are found to be installed in the expected locations (see below).
REM
REM To compile for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0, you must have Microsoft
REM Visual Studio .NET 2002 installed in the standard path proposed by
REM by its installer.
REM
REM To compile for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1, you must have Microsoft
REM Visual Studio .NET 2003 installed in the standard path proposed by
REM by its installer.
REM
REM To compile for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0, you only need 
REM MSBUILD.EXE (version 4.0, part of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0) and 
REM which is expected to be located in the standard installation directory.
